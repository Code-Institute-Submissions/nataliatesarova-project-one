### The landing page image
* The landing page has a pleasant image of a woman's eyes which immediately tells the viewer that the site is ophthalmic. The image of eyes literally makes eye contact with the user.

### Introduction to the clinic and main surgeon
* Information on the educational and training background of the principle surgeon and clinic owner, and the high level of care and treatment that patients can expect.

### Footer
* The footer contains the icons and links to the clinic's social media sites on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter that will open in new tabs.

### Features left to implement
* A possible future enhancement would be to add javascript to send an email directly to the Wave Eye Clinic.

## Testing

### Responsiveness
* All pages were tested for resposiveness on 320px and up using the developer tools. The web site was tested on Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Opera browsers with iPhone SE, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, Samsung Galaxy S8+, Ipad Air devices.
* The web site opened as expected with no responsive issues in all cases apart from the navigation bar appearing too crowded on the smaller device screens. This issue was fixed by decreasing the navigation bar text font size.

### Validator
* HTML: Errors were not found when passing through the official W3C validator

![validator](assets/doc/thankyou.png)
* CSS: Errors were not found when passing through the official Jigsaw validator (DO TEST AND INSERT PIC)

### Accessibility
* Adobe Color was used to test contrast for accessibility. (INSERT PIC OF ADOBE COLOR TEST)
* Wave accessibility (DO TEST CHANGE FONT COLOR AND INSERT PIC-LIGHTHOUSE ALSO TESTS ACCESSIBILITY)
* Lighthouse in the Chrome Developer Tools was used to test website performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO. (INSERT PIC)

### Bugs
An error was found with the footer since the h3 ("Follow Wave Eye Clinic") was placed in the ul. This was fixed by moving the h3 above the ul. Wave testing showed an empty link error with regard to the clinic logo. This did not appear to have any bearing on the website function and will be addressed in a future release.
